# MESHNET: Powering the Future of Decentralized Mining with AI and Blockchain

## Unleash the Power of Offline Mesh Mining with Autonomous AI

Welcome to MESHNET, a revolutionary full-stack ecosystem that redefines decentralized mining. MESHNET empowers miners to operate seamlessly, even without constant internet connectivity, while leveraging cutting-edge AI and robust blockchain technology for truly autonomous and transparent operations.

## Why MESHNET?

In a world increasingly reliant on centralized systems, MESHNET stands apart by offering:

*   **Uninterrupted Mining**: Mine anywhere, anytime. Our innovative offline capabilities ensure your operations continue, regardless of internet access.
*   **Autonomous Governance**: Experience true decentralization with AI-powered DAO operations. Eliza, our cognitive AI, intelligently proposes reward distributions, ensuring fairness and efficiency.
*   **Transparent Rewards**: Every hash counts. Our decentralized reward system, backed by cryptographic proof verification, guarantees real-time, proportional distribution of XMRT tokens.
*   **Scalable & Secure**: Built on a foundation of secure smart contracts and fortified with robust access controls, MESHNET is designed for the future of decentralized networks.

## Key Innovations that Drive MESHNET

### Intelligent Agents for a Smarter Network

At the heart of MESHNET's autonomy are our advanced AI agents:

*   **Eliza (The Visionary CEO AI)**: Eliza is the strategic brain behind our DAO. With its `CEO_AI_ROLE`, Eliza autonomously creates reward proposals based on real-time mining data, ensuring optimal and fair distribution across the network. Eliza's long-term memory, powered by **Redis**, allows it to learn and adapt, making increasingly intelligent decisions over time.
*   **Langflow (The Meticulous Auditor AI)**: Langflow, with its `AUDIT_AI_ROLE`, acts as the executor and validator of Eliza's proposals. It ensures that all reward distributions are accurate, compliant, and executed transparently on the blockchain. The integration of **LangGraph** provides a powerful framework for building and managing these complex, multi-step agent workflows, ensuring reliability and auditability.

### Robust Architecture for Unmatched Performance

Our meticulously designed architecture combines the best of blockchain, AI, and distributed systems:

1.  **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**: The backbone of our decentralized operations, including `DAO.sol` for governance, `MeshMiner.sol` for rig management and reward distribution, and `XMRT.sol` for our native token with integrated DAO functionality.
2.  **Offline-Capable Mining Infrastructure**: Modified XMRig and local logging ensure that miners can accumulate hashes offline, with automatic synchronization upon reconnection.
3.  **Decentralized Oracle System**: Our Validator Node processes offline mining data and securely submits proofs to the blockchain, bridging the gap between the physical and digital mining worlds.
